        Question 2

        This question is four marks and requires you to make some application of some concept in the case study.

        Sample Question
        
        How to Respond
        The way you get the marks is to write each step on a separate line so the examiner can follow your logic. Use bullet points.

        Question 3

        This question is for six marks and requires an extended response. Typically, the exam qill require you to either explain a concept in detail or evaluate the pros and cons of
        two related concepts in the case study. One other favorite exam question is to compare and contrast two concepts.

        Sample questions

        How to Respond
        To get full marks on an explnation, stick to "subject verb object" sentences - simple and clear. Use connecting phrases such as "that means..." or 
        "for example" to show the examiners that you know what you are talking about.

        For a compare and contrast, a table is ususally a good way to go. Take a look at the following table to see an example.

        <table>

        </table>

        Question 4

        This question for 12 marks is the hardest question and will require the most time. You will be given a prompt and expected to write an extended essay to answer it.
        The essay is designed to be open ended without a clear right or wrong in which you are given a context and a statement and asked to evaluate the validity
        of that statement.

        Sample Question
        
        How to Respond
        To get the best mark, you must show that you have undertaken independant research and show that you can connect the concepts in the case study
        to the concepts covered in the course. Use heading titles in your response to show the examiner how your response is strucuted. In addition,
        you must have several examples ready to go to use in your response.
