                <p> Question 1 is divided into two parts, each worth two marks. These questions tend to focus on
                    your understanding of the vocabulary list in the case study
                    The questions typically require you to provide a definition of the term.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p> This question is for six marks and requires an extended response. Typically, the exam will require
                    you to either explain a concept in detail or evaluate the pros and cons of
                    two related concepts in the case study. One other favorite exam question is to compare and contrast
                    two concepts.</p>
                <p>
                    There is not enough material in the case study for you to answer these questions. You must research the content yourself.

                <h3>How to Respond</h3>
                <p>To get full marks on an explnation, stick to "subject verb object" sentences - simple and clear. Use
                    connecting phrases such as "that means..." or "for example" to show the examiners that you know what
                    you are talking about.</p>
                <p>For a compare and contrast, a table is ususally a good way to go. Take a look at the following table
                    to see an example.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This question for 12 marks is the hardest question and will require the most time. You will be given
                    a prompt and expected to write an extended essay to answer it.
                    The essay is designed to be open ended without a clear right or wrong in which you are given a
                    context and a
                    statement and asked to evaluate the validity of that statement.</p>

                    data, in terms of both security and accuracy.  Are the investors' concerns justified? In an extended response, explain how Alice and Bob might address the concerns of the investors.</p>

                <p>To what extent can the developers in charge of implementing the NextStar system be confident in the accuracy of its recommndations?</p>

                <h3>How to Respond</h3>
                <p>To get the best mark, you must show that you have undertaken independant research and show that you
                    can connect the concepts in the case study to the concepts covered in the course. Use heading titles in
                    your response to show the examiner how your response is strucuted. In addition, you must have several
                    examples ready to go to use in your response.
